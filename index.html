        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          If I had a biography to write, I wouldn't have wasted doing this
          pointless course and making this stupid dumbass website. That too by
          being extremely frustrated cause I miss-spelled one of CSS's idiotic
          element's name and now my website looks like garbage. Although It was
          never better, means it's always been grabage. But if you ask me what I
          would to be in my life. My answer would be very simple.No, I don't
          want a job which is very simple. I literally wanna become very simple.
          It's kinda complicated to explain it here in text. What about
          discussing it over a cup of coffee? don't worry, I'll let you pay the
          bill.
