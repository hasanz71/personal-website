        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          If I had a biography to write, I wouldn't have wasted doing this
          pointless course and making this stupid dumbass website. That too by
          being extremely frustrated cause I miss-spelled one of CSS's idiotic
          element's name and now my website looks like garbage. Although It was
          never better, means it's always been grabage. <br />
          But if you ask what I would wanna be in my life, My answer would be
          very simple.No, I don't want a job which is very simple. I literally
          wanna become very simple. It's kinda complicated to explain here in
          text. What about discussing it over a cup of coffee? don't worry, I'll
          let you pay the bill.
